After taking his degree in law began to practise at the bar with but slight success. He wrote indifferent verses, but was a redoubtable pamphleteer. After the League had arrested the royalist members of parliament, he was appointed (1589) advocate-general. His ``Avertissement des catholiques anglais aux Français catholiques du danger où ils sont de perdre la religion et d’expérimenter, comme en Angleterre, la cruauté des ministres s’ils reçoivent à la couronne un roi qui soit hérétique'' went through several editions, and was translated into English. One of his pamphlets, Le Banquet ou après-dînée du comte d’Arète, in which he accused Henry of insincerity in his return to the Roman Catholic faith, was so scurrilous as to be disapproved of by many members of the League. When Henry at length entered Paris, Dorléans was among the number of the proscribed. He took refuge in Antwerp, where he remained for nine years.

Next year he became tutor and chaplain in the family of Sir Thomas Roberts, at Glassenbury, near Cranbrook, Kent. In 1699 he became assistant to Thomas Reynolds at the Weighhouse presbyterian chapel, Eastcheap, and soon afterwards became one of the evening lecturers at Lime Street. In 1706 or 1707 he succeeded Glascock as pastor of the presbyterian congregation in Drury Street, Westminster. In 1708 he joined with four presbyterians and an independent (Thomas Bradbury) in a course of Friday evening lectures at the Weighhouse on the conduct of public religious worship. He increased his congregation, partly by help of a secession from the ministry of Daniel Burgess (1645--1713), and removed it to a new meeting-house in Hanover Street, Long Acre. At Hanover Street he established a Thursday morning lecture, and maintained it till Christmas 1767. In the Salters' Hall conferences in 1719 Earle was one of the twenty-seven presbyterian subscribers. In 1723 he was elected one of the trustees of Dr. Williams's foundations.

He commenced his artistic career by carving in wood, and then designed illustrations for unimportant works, executing in 1799 ten plates for Goethe's 'Hermann and Dorothea. ' He next worked in Indian ink and water-colours, producing in 1806 a large piece in the latter medium, representing 'The Death of Nicholas of Bernau,' which gained him admission into the Berlin Academy. In 1807 he went to Paris, where he studied oil painting. The year 1812 found him at Rome, and there his education as an artist was much advanced by his connection with Koch, Overbeck, Schadow, and Cornelius. His inclination led him more especially in the direction of painting landscapes with architectural details or prominent figures introduced. He attached himself to the new classic school of landscape, labouring especially to make his perspective tell effectively, and to gain a great mastery over light and shade. His ideas gained much in point of breadth from a visit to Sicily, which he made in company with Prince Golitsuin in 1818. He settled at Macerata in 1830, but returned home on a visit in 1840, on which occasion a professorship was bestowed on him by the King of Prussia.

Coming to Melbourne, he obtained a position at Parer's hotel where he eventually became a chef. It has been stated that the modelling of ornaments for wedding cakes first turned his thoughts in the direction of sculpture. He entered the national gallery drawing school in 1888 and attended for two and a half years, but never went on to the painting school. In the late 1890s he began to exhibit at the Yarra Sculptors' Society and the Victorian Artists' Society. Until 1905 his work was all in marble and when he began experimenting in casting in bronze he met with many difficulties and could find no one in Melbourne to help him. He persevered, became an excellent caster, and among others did portrait heads in bronze of John Mather, A. McClintock, John Shirlow, Hugh McCrae and Bernard O'Dowd. The last was acquired for the National Gallery of Victoria in 1913 under the Felton bequest. In May 1914, encouraged and helped by an American resident of Melbourne, Hugo Meyer, Gilbert went to London and in spite of the war persevered with his work as he was well over military age . He exhibited at the Royal Academy where the sincerity of his work met with early appreciation, and in 1917 his marble head ``The Critic'' was purchased for the Tate Gallery through the Chantrey Bequest. He was nominated also for an associateship of the Royal Academy. He was then employed as a war artist by the Commonwealth government and made, for the war museum, many models of land over which the Australians fought.

In October 1838 he was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, where in 1841 he was elected a scholar. He was reading with good hopes for classical honours, and was a private pupil of Dr. Vaughan; but even at that early age he was suffering from the disease to which he eventually succumbed. Although the state of his health prevented him from competing for university honours or obtaining a college fellowship, he was known to possess ability; and soon after taking his degree he was appointed college librarian (4 June 1845). He held this office until a few weeks before his death, when he returned to his father's house. Physical weakness prevented the sustained effort necessary for the production of any important work; but for the last six years of his life he contributed to the press. Most of his writings appeared in the Spectator or in Fraser's Magazine, the only one to which his name was attached being an essay on Tennyson's poems, contributed to the Cambridge Essays of 1855. He died 29 May 1857. A selection of his essays was made after his death and published with a prefatory memoir by W. G. Clark. This volume contains notices of a large number of the writers who were contemporary with Brimley himself, and is of considerable value as representing the contemporary judgment by a man of cultivation and acuteness on the writers of the middle of the nineteenth century, most of whom are now being judged by posterity. Sir Arthur Helps said of him, 'He was certainly, as it appeared to me, one of the finest critics of the present day.

His pictures met with considerable success, though in the opinion of critics of more modern days he never attained any real approximation to the works of those masters. He was admitted into the Academy of St. Luke at Rome in 1686, and in 1694 into that of Paris.

He became deeply interested in the legal status of the medical profession, and organised the Association of Surgeon-Apothecaries of England and Wales, with the object of improving the education and status of the profession. As chairman of this body Burrows was most indefatigable, and had a large share in the movement which led to the passing of the Apothecaries' Act in 1815. The society voted him five hundred guineas on its dissolution. On the formation of the first court of examiners of the Apothecaries' Company, on the passing of the act, Burrows was appointed an examiner; but early in 1817 he resigned, owing to the unfair conduct of the court of assistants. On this question Burrows published a Statement of Circumstances connected with the Apothecaries' Act and its Administration in 1817.

His parents rented a small manor in Zaduszniki, but soon after Ignacy's birth had to move to Rzeszów due to economical difficulties. There Ignacy started his studies at the local gymnasium, but had to abandon it in 1836. To help his parents, Ignacy Łukasiewicz moved to Łańcut where he started to work as a pharmacist's assistant. At the same time he became involved in various political organizations supporting the idea of restoration of Polish sovereignty. In 1840 he returned to Rzeszów, where he continued to practice at the pharmacy of Edward Hübl. In 1845 he met Edward Dembowski, who admitted Łukasiewicz to the illegal Centralization of the Polish Democratic Society. The aim of that organization was to prepare an all-national uprising against the partitioning powers. Because of that, on February 19, 1846 Łukasiewicz was arrested by the Austrian authorities and imprisoned in Lwów. On December 27, 1847 he was released from prison due to lack of evidence, but for the rest of his life he was regarded as politically insecure.

He was educated at a private school and began work for his father's firm about the age of 14. By 1819 he had become a partner in his father's business and was soon noted for his ability as a cotton buyer. His business prospered, and the firm traded with China, India, South America and the United States, dealing in many other commodities. For a time he was in partneship with Samuel Faulkner whose son George was his closest friend. The business was carried on at Carpenter's Lane in Manchester while Owens resided at Nelson Street, Chorlton on Medlock. It is recorded that he was a man of very retiring habits who kept no company whatever. He spent evenings quietly among his books. He was a Liberal in politics and a Congregationalist by religion though in his later life he left off worshipping in chapel and attended an Anglican church. His large fortune he suggested leaving to his friend and partner George Faulkner (1790--1860), already a rich man. But by the latter's advice he bequeathed it to trustees for the foundation of a college (Owens College, Manchester, opened 1851, now part of the University of Manchester), based upon his own ideas of education. His will was made in May 1845. He died in Manchester unmarried and without issue on the 29th of July 1846: his bequests to friends and charities amounted to some £52,000, while for the college he left £96,654.

Daly's translation was the first Sanguineti book to be rendered into English. According to the publishers, Dedalus Press/Dufour Editions, Daly accepted the difficult task of translating Libretto ``because he finds Sanguineti's poetry so lifeaffirming, and because he believes that even the poorest translation may lead people to read more of him.'' His latest collection of poems is Clinging to the Myth (2007) in which he refelects on grief and personal bereavement and uses the voices of 18th century Gaelic poetry to respond to the challenges of a post-Christian Ireland.

He thus had the opportunity to meet some of the prominent intellectuals of Southern Italy, including Giuseppe Maria Galanti, who in a letter to Vincenzo's father described the young man as capace, di molta abilità e di molto talento (``able, of great skill and great talent''), although trascurato (``slovenly'') and indolente (``indolent''); Galanti was probably not entirely satisfied at Vincenzo's collaboration on his Descrizione Geografica e Politica delle Sicilie.

The resulting images include allusions to the material by which the models are absorbed or into which they disappear. His work was included in the 120 year survey of the nude exhibition ``Body Work'' at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, alongside the work of Edward Weston, Bill Brandt, Eadweard Muybridge, E. J. Bellocq, and Edward Steichen. Bernhard later continued to devote all his energy taking photographs and bringing them together to enhance their meaning with visual interplay. This is evident in his ``Diptychs'' and sequencing series ``Drift''. He was profiled in the documentary show ``Temps Present'' on Swiss Television TSR (Switzerland) and the global network TV5 Monde.

In 1958 he began earning his living as a professional author, and from 1976 on he was permanently employed by Norddeutscher Rundfunk Hamburg as a director of radio plays. His short stories and novels very often deal with ``losers'' -- as a very young man, he himself became handicapped while at war. His work shows Paul Pörtner to be a writer who was deeply drawn to the burlesque as well as having his characters act in desperate ways. He loved experimental language and word play. His interest in avant-garde theatre led him to the theories of Jacob Levy Moreno, Antonin Artaud and Erwin Piscator. However, through his work on stage as director and playwright he fell under the charm of the commedia dell'arte, Kurt Schwitters or Alfred Jarry. In 1963 Paul Pörtner invented the interactive play Scherenschnitt oder Der Mörder sind Sie where the audience takes over the leading role. It premiered the same year at the Ulmer Theatre, and thereafter, 75 German-speaking theatres followed. In the USA Scherenschnitt, entitled Shear Madness, became the longest running play ever done in American history. Eighteen productions in other countries have made Scherenschnitt a singular international hit: following Agatha Christie`s Mouse Trap, Paul Pörtner`s interactive play is the longest-running play around the world. In addition to 17 theatre plays, Pörtner wrote more than 20 radio plays that are still influential in this typically German genre."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1014448455121957356","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16169597761094238409","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"17082466750572480596","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"11595942516201422884","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"2050861176556883424","judgment":"yes"}]}

Zavaleta was an extremely influential Bolivian thinker of the second half of twentieth century. His thought is usually divided in to three periods: the first nationalist, followed by an orthodox Marxist phase, and finally his more influential unorthodox Marxism from a uniquely Bolivian perspective. Concepts originating from his work are fundamental to later development in Bolivian social sciences. Notable concepts such as ``sociedad abigarrada'' (roughly translated ``motley society''), meaning a society juxtaposed by asymmetric relations of differentiated cultural power and its respective modes of production. Additionally considered important are Zavaleta's meaning of the terms ``mases'' (``masses'') and ``multitude''.

On May 6, the City of Ottawa honoured volunteers at the ninth annual Civic Appreciation Awards Ceremony. Megan Ellwood, who grew up in Kanata and now resides in Stittsville, won the citizen of the year youth award. She is described as a 'wonderful example of a truly dedicated volunteer ...who has a kind heart and has everyone else's best interests in mind. ' Ellwood graduated from Earl of March Secondary School in 2008 and in 2007 was also honoured by the city with the Community Activist Award. The 19-year-old just finished her second year of the Child Youth and Family Program for her Bachelor of Applied Science at the University of Guelph. She is working towards becoming a special education teacher or a counselor.She has been volunteering since she was 11 years old and describes volunteering as something that is just part of her routine now. She was surprised and excited when she found out she won the award. ''I was very shocked because I surround myself with people who are very involved in volunteerism. I really enjoy it. Some people may think it's a burden but for me it's something I really enjoy,`` said Ellwood. ''If I can share that passion with other people it not only gets them involved but also helps the organization overall and it's a lot of fun. `` She explains that volunteering helps people figure out what they want to do in their life. One key thing she has enjoyed about volunteering is the connections she has made with different people. She thinks she has come to know more than half of her closest friends through volunteering. Her family is extremely excited of her achievements. Her grandmother Heather Livingston describes her as the kind of person who just can't sit still and has to be always doing something. ''We are very proud of her she has worked very hard, so I think she fully deserves it. She has always been a person who over does everything. We are very proud of her,`` said Livingston. I think it is wonderful, she just has that personality and character not just with children with special needs but children of all ages, elderly people, are just attracted to her and people go to her for help.'' Livingston says she just loves volunteering and is always willing to help out and never says no, even if it is someone who needs extra attention at the pool she always wants to help. Ellwood has volunteered as a peer mentor with children with special needs, with aquatics, music lessons, guiding and as a volunteer coach for the Ontario Special Olympics. She was attracted to people with special needs she thinks because her great-grandmother was in a wheel chair and close family friends had special needs so she was exposed at a young age. ``I think it's neat because children with special needs are very different than most children. They hit different learning milestones at different times,'' said Ellwood. ``They really surprise you sometimes. They are all very unique and all have very special skills and interests. It's a lot of fun.'' At university this year she won the Programming Award for running the most programs to get students involved. In 2008, she won the Zonta Club of Ottawa's Humanitarianism Award for influential women in the community and she has also won four community based scholarships. ``"}],"judgments":[{"rater":"11595942516201422884","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"1014448455121957356","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16169597761094238409","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"17082466750572480596","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"5505751039176460562","judgment":"no"}]}

While Waldman was working at the Pain Clinic at Mayo, clinicians Lee Nauss and Joe Wang brought Yaksh's exciting basic science discoveries into clinical practice by being among the first physicians to inject morphine into the subarachnoid space to treat pain. This experience fueled Waldman's interest in pain management and led him to return to his home town of Kansas City, Missouri to establish one of the first full time private practices of pain management in the country. Recognizing the need for education about the specialty of pain management and what it could offer patients suffering from pain, Waldman lectured around the country on the unrealized potential of the specialty and begin writing extensively on the subject. Serving on the Editorial Boards of numerous journals devoted to pain including The Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, Pain Digest, The American Journal of Pain Management, Headache Quarterly, Archives of Oncology, and as Editor-In Chief of Analgesiafile, Waldman further helped define the specialty of pain management. He also began teaching at the UMKC School of Medicine where he has remained on the clinical faculty for almost 30 years. As the only full time practitioner of pain management in the Kansas City area in the early 1980s, Waldman opened pain management clinics in over 20 area hospitals and by doing so established the specialty of pain management as an integral and necessary part of patient care in the region. In 1983, Waldman founded The Headache & Pain Center in Leawood, Kansas(a Kansas City suburb), the first single specialty accredited surgical center devoted solely to the treatment of pain in the nation. The Center ultimately employed 28 full time physicians in the specialties of pain management, neurology, orthopedic surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and neurosurgery, attracting patients from all over the country. He later, with other area physicians opened Doctors Hospital to provide an inpatient facility which specialized in more advanced pain management treatments such as implantable technologies which often required in-patient stays. Waldman sold his interest in the Center and Hospital in 2008 to devote his time to teaching and writing."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"16651790297630307764","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"1014448455121957356","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16169597761094238409","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"17082466750572480596","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"11595942516201422884","judgment":"no"}]}

Born in Madiun, East Java, the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), he studied at Gadjah Mada University, Cornell University and in 1963 graduated with an MA from Yale University. His debut as a writer came early with the publication of Simphoni (Symphony), a collection of poems, in 1957. The collection has been described as ``cynical, untamed poetry, shocking sometimes''. Simphoni was followed by several attempts at short story writing, including the publication Kedjananan di Sumbing (Manhood on Mount Sumbing), before Subagio settled on poetry as his main creative outlet. Following an extended stay in the United States he published a collection of poems entitled Saldju (Snow) in 1966. The poems in this collection deal with questions of life and death, and of the need for ``something to hold on to in an existence threatened on all sides'', and have been described as altogether more restrained than those in his earlier work. Additional works published since 1966 include Daerab Perbatasan (Border Region) (1970), Keroncong Motinggo (Montinggo's Song) (1975), Buku Harian (Diary), Hari dan Hara (1979)Simphoni Dua (1990), and several books of literary criticism.

He started to play guitar at twelve years old, and by seventeen, he was discovered by Norman Whitfield of Motown Records. Soon after, he became a regular session player for the famed studios. The first song he ever played on was ``Papa was a Rolling Stone'' by The Temptations. That year the album won five Grammy Awards. After playing on numerous albums, when Motown moved offices to California they paid for him to move so they could continue using his services as a session guitar player. He soon joined the group Rare Earth and is credited as being co-writer on three songs from the Back to Earth album. After quitting Motown as a studio player in 1975, Ray Manzarek of The Doors employed Paul to become lead guitarist for his new band Nite City. By their second album Paul had also become the lead singer and wrote a number of songs on the Album Golden Days Diamond Night. The band had separated by the release of their second album. Paul Warren by 1978 had formed his own band Paul Warren and Explorer - and was a regular on the Sunset Strip scene playing almost every weekend at either the Roxy, Whiskey a Go Go, the Starwood, and Madame Wongs in China Town - among many others. He was signed by RSO Records and released his first solo album One of the Kids in 1980. Later that year RSO Records folded and Paul Warren found himself unemployed. He began being a guitar player for hire between the years 1981 and 1987, working for such greats and The Ventures, Tina Turner and Prism. He is also credited as producing a number of records in this era. In 1987 he joined Richard Marx at the beginning of his career soon after the first release of his first song from his debut album. Paul was Richard Marx's Musical Director for seven years before quitting in 1994, as his career as an artist was coming to an end. The day after quitting Richard he went straight out on the road to work as lead guitarist for Joe Cocker. The ``Have a Little Faith Tour'' lasted eighteen months. In 1996 he was then employed by Italian singer Eros Ramazzotti. His guitar playing for Eros lasted eleven years before quitting for good in 2005. In the interim in 1999 he was employed in between tours with Eros to work as guitarist for Rod Stewart. He has now been playing for Stewart for eleven years. In late 2010 he is releasing his first solo album in over a decade to be entitled Round Trip with his band The Paul Warren Project"}],"judgments":[{"rater":"17082466750572480596","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16169597761094238409","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"11658533362118524115","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"2050861176556883424","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1014448455121957356","judgment":"no"}]}
