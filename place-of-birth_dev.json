From him he learned the elements of arithmetic. A gentleman of Bath, named Kingston, heard of the boy's taste for mathematics, and gave him some help. He became usher in a school at Stoke, near Bristol, and after a while took a similar situation in another school in the neighbourhood. While thus employed, he took every opportunity of increasing his mathematical knowledge. Nevil Maskelyne, the astronomer-royal, happened to hear of his talents, and engaged him as an assistant at the Royal Observatory. On his recommendation Bayly, in 1769, was sent out by the Royal Society to North Cape, Norway to observe the transit of Venus that occurred in that year, and his observations were printed in the Philosophical Transactions of the society. In 1772 he accompanied William Wales as an astronomer on Cook's second voyage of discovery to the southern hemisphere. The two ships employed in the expedition, the Resolution and the Adventure, sailed on 13 June. He also sailed in Cook's third and last voyage made with the Resolution and the Discovery, which cleared the channel on 14 July 1776.

Smith was not called to the bar until 1849, as he interrupted his legal studies to settle between 1837 and 1842 with his new wife Martha in America where he lectured on philosophy and phrenology. Joshua Smith was an incessant writer. In 1839 he gained a diploma of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Copenhagen for his work The Discovery of America by the Northmen in the Tenth Century, while his interest in geology and subsequent papers led to him being offered the position of President of the newly formed Geologists' Association, which he declined. However, the main focus of his writings for many years was as a proponent of local self-government through traditional institutions, such as the parish, the vestry and the ward, a subject also taken up by his daughter Lucy Toulmin Smith. After the cholera epidemic of 1847, Smith's knowledge of law combined with his involvement in his own Highgate neighbourhood led to his demanding better sanitation and reforms advocating devolution and local responsibility. In 1851 his work Local Self-Government and Centralisation was published and followed in 1854 by The Parish and its Obligations and Powers."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"16651790297630307764","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1014448455121957356","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"2050861176556883424","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"16169597761094238409","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"11595942516201422884","judgment":"yes"}]}

While apprenticed to a writer to the signet in Edinburgh, young Ainslie in 1787 formed the acquaintance of Burns, and in May of the same year he made an excursion with the poet in Teviotdale and Berwickshire. Burns stayed some days at Berrywell. A sister of Ainslie, whom Burns met on this occasion, was the subject of the impromptu beginning with ''Fair maid. `` Ainslie passed writer to the signet in 1789. He became an elder in the Church of Scotland, and was the author of two small religious works, ''A Father's Gift to his Children,`` and ''Reasons for the Hope that is in us. `` He also contributed to the ''Edinburgh Magazine`` and other periodicals. His intimacy with Burns, and his genial manners, secured him a cordial welcome in the literary circles of Edinburgh. Hogg, who speaks of him as ''honest Ainslie,`` mentions, as his one failing, constitutional sleepiness, the irresistibility of which Hogg, with characteristic egotism, illustrates by stating that he has ''seen him fall fast asleep in the blue parlour at Ambrose's, with North in the chair and myself croupier. `` Fourteen letters of Burns to Ainslie are included in the poet's correspondence.

On May 6, the City of Ottawa honoured volunteers at the ninth annual Civic Appreciation Awards Ceremony. Megan Ellwood, who grew up in Kanata and now resides in Stittsville, won the citizen of the year youth award. She is described as a 'wonderful example of a truly dedicated volunteer ...who has a kind heart and has everyone else's best interests in mind. ' Ellwood graduated from Earl of March Secondary School in 2008 and in 2007 was also honoured by the city with the Community Activist Award. The 19-year-old just finished her second year of the Child Youth and Family Program for her Bachelor of Applied Science at the University of Guelph. She is working towards becoming a special education teacher or a counselor.She has been volunteering since she was 11 years old and describes volunteering as something that is just part of her routine now. She was surprised and excited when she found out she won the award. ''I was very shocked because I surround myself with people who are very involved in volunteerism. I really enjoy it. Some people may think it's a burden but for me it's something I really enjoy,`` said Ellwood. ''If I can share that passion with other people it not only gets them involved but also helps the organization overall and it's a lot of fun. `` She explains that volunteering helps people figure out what they want to do in their life. One key thing she has enjoyed about volunteering is the connections she has made with different people. She thinks she has come to know more than half of her closest friends through volunteering. Her family is extremely excited of her achievements. Her grandmother Heather Livingston describes her as the kind of person who just can't sit still and has to be always doing something. ''We are very proud of her she has worked very hard, so I think she fully deserves it. She has always been a person who over does everything. We are very proud of her,`` said Livingston. I think it is wonderful, she just has that personality and character not just with children with special needs but children of all ages, elderly people, are just attracted to her and people go to her for help.'' Livingston says she just loves volunteering and is always willing to help out and never says no, even if it is someone who needs extra attention at the pool she always wants to help. Ellwood has volunteered as a peer mentor with children with special needs, with aquatics, music lessons, guiding and as a volunteer coach for the Ontario Special Olympics. She was attracted to people with special needs she thinks because her great-grandmother was in a wheel chair and close family friends had special needs so she was exposed at a young age. ``I think it's neat because children with special needs are very different than most children. They hit different learning milestones at different times,'' said Ellwood. ``They really surprise you sometimes. They are all very unique and all have very special skills and interests. It's a lot of fun.'' At university this year she won the Programming Award for running the most programs to get students involved. In 2008, she won the Zonta Club of Ottawa's Humanitarianism Award for influential women in the community and she has also won four community based scholarships. ``"}],"judgments":[{"rater":"4464315225392470006","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16169597761094238409","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"2050861176556883424","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"1014448455121957356","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16651790297630307764","judgment":"yes"}]}

He returned to Westminster School as usher till he was appointed head-master of the grammar school at Woodstock. He was a successful teacher, and numbered among his pupils several sons of noble families. An ardent royalist he was chosen to preach the thanksgiving sermon for the Restoration at St. Mary's, Oxford, 27 May 1660, and afterwards published it under the title of ''David's Return from Banishment. `` He also published ''Votivum Carolo, or a Welcome to his sacred Majesty Charles II from the Master and Scholars of Woodstock School,`` a volume of English and Latin verses composed by Gregory and his pupils. Shortly afterwards he became head-master of a newly founded school at Witney, Oxfordshire, and 22 Sept. 1661 he was incorporated D.D. of Oxford University from St. Mary Hall. He was appointed a chaplain to the king, and in 1671 was presented by Earl Rivers to the living of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire. He. kept this post till his death in 1707. He was buried in the church, where a tablet was erected to his memory. Gregory published : 1. ''Έτυμολογικòν μικρòν, sive Etymologicum parvum ex magno illo Sylburgii, Eustathio Martinio, aliisque magni nominis auctoribus excerptum,`` 1654, practically a Greek-Latin lexicon. 2.

One female figure made entirely of recycled glass and internally illuminated is positioned alongside her concrete carbon copy. The pose of the figures respond to the flow of the water and act as an environmental barometer in the river by highlighting water quality from the amount of algal growth. In 2008 he worked alongside the children's television program ''Smart Art`` to produce an educational art piece The Inverted Solitude. Situated in the National Diving and Activity Centre (Chepstow), England, a desolate figure of a man is suspended head down from a diving pontoon into a quarry that has a depth of 80 meters. When looking up at the figure from below a reflected image is presented on the surface of the water. Also in 2008 Taylor created a land-based stone sculpture, hosted by the Municipality of Paliani Stone Symposium in Crete, Greece, August 2008 ''The Un-still Life II`` carved from a block of travertine stone and is a terrestrial counterpart to the original underwater piece in Moilinere Bay.

He was the second-place candidate in the 1992 presidential election. Matiba became a senior civil servant at a young age of 31. Even before Kenya attained its independence in December 1963, Matiba had already joined the high echelons of the Kenya's civil service becoming the first indigenous African Permanent Secretary for Education in May 1963. Matiba was the fair-eyed boy of Carey Francis the Head Master of Alliance High School who lobbied for his promotion to the Permanent Secretary's position. In 1964 he was appointed the Permanent Secretaryfor Commerce under the minister Mwai Kibaki. Matiba's star continued to shine in the post-colonial period helped by his connections with the prominent Kiambu family of Musa Gitau who was one of the first Africans to become the Minister of the Presbyterian Church in Kenya. Matiba's wife Edith is Musa Gitau's daughter. Musa Gitau had a hand in molding the early life of Jomo Kenyatta having taught him at the PCEA Center at Thogoto, Kikuyu. In the patron-client reward system that Kenyatta established after independence such connections were vital for one to succeed in public career or in business. Matiba was to later abandon his civil service career to venture into Hotel hospitality industry. He established the Alliance Group of Hostels setting his base at South Coast. He also invested in high cost private schools, including Hillcrest Preparatory (founded by Frank Thompson) and Hillcrest Secondary School. Kenneth Matiba was the chairman of Kenya Football Federation from 1974 to 1978. He was elected to the Kenyan Parliament at the 1983 general elections from Mbiri Constituency (later renamed Kiharu Constituency) in Muranga District. He served as a Minister of Transport and Communications, under the KANU administration led by then president Daniel arap Moi, but Matiba resigned from his post in December 1988. At Moi's instructions Matiba was detained at the Kamiti Maximum Security Prison in 1990 without trial. He was imprisoned together with Charles Rubia, another leading figure calling for multiparty democracy. Whilst there Matiba was refused medication and suffered a massive stroke, which affected half of his body and incapacitated him for some time. Later, a multiparty system was inaugurated and Matiba was released. He was part of the opposition alliance that formed the popular movement by the name Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD). During the December 1992 election, he was the candidate of FORD-Asili, a party that he had helped found by splintering from the original FORD. President Moi won the elections on KANU's ticket, while Matiba placed second. Matiba won Kiharu Constituency parliamentary seat at the parliamentary elections held concurrently. Matiba boycotted the December 1997 election, citing lack of democracy, and even burned his voter's card. Matiba has a long-standing rivalry with the current Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki. Before the December 2002 election, Matiba was leader of the small Saba Saba Asili party, which declined to join the NARC coalition. Matiba did not run for the presidency or for a parliamentary seat. More recently, Matiba has been dogged by ill-health which stemmed from his imprisonment years before. Additionally, his business empire has suffered with first his hotel chain briefly being taken into administration, although he has since regained control, and then his Hillcrest Schools being sold by administrators, a case which he took to court. He has since regained control of the school which he later sold to a consortium led by Fanisi. Matiba is also founder of The People newspaper. It started as a weekly in 1992, but turned to daily in 1998. The paper is one problem contributing to Matiba's troubled finances. As of 2008, he is still the chairman of Saba Saba Asili. In addition, he has re-registered as a voter. In November 2007, he announced that he would be a presidential candidate in the December 2007 election. He placed seventh with 8,046 votes. Matiba lives in Riara Ridge in Rironi, near Limuru (as of 2010). He is married to Edith His son Raymond Matiba is former chairman of the Kenya Tourist Board. In 2000 he released his autobiography ``Aiming High''"}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1014448455121957356","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"16169597761094238409","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"11595942516201422884","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"16651790297630307764","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"2050861176556883424","judgment":"yes"}]}
