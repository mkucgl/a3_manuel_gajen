These methods are widely used to compute continuum processes dominated by wave propagation. On the following day, 3 May, Godunov received an honorary degree from the University of Michigan. Godunov's theorem (Godunov, 1959) (also known as Godunov's order barrier theorem) : Linear numerical schemes for solving partial differential equations, having the property of not generating new extrema (a monotone scheme), can be at most first-order accurate. Godunov's scheme is a conservative numerical scheme for solving partial differential equations. In this method, the conservative variables are considered as piecewise constant over the mesh cells at each time step and the time evolution is determined by the exact solution of the Riemann (shock tube) problem at the inter-cell boundaries (Hirsch, 1990)."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1295059937994543754","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16671464637895630418","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"6905422328658452998","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"10865367442061928261","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"18153321702395861849","judgment":"no"}]}

As a result, in 1605, William received the courtesy title of Viscount Cranborne. In 1608, aged 17, Cranborne's father sent him to France, but quickly recalled him to England to marry Catherine, the daughter of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk in December 1608. His father was determined that Cranborne should spend two years living abroad, and instructed him to return to France following his marriage. However, in mid-1610, James I determined to have his son Henry installed as Prince of Wales and Salisbury (who was currently serving as Lord High Treasurer) instructed his son to return for the ceremony: Cranborne subsequently held the king's train for the ceremony. Following this ceremony, Cranborne returned to Europe, this time to Italy, travelling first to Venice, then to Padua.

He immediately took up a lectureship at Edinburgh University in Scotland and then to the surprise of many, he left for Raffles College in Malaysia. According to The Independent, Oppenheim, who was always sensitive about ill-informed criticism of institutions of higher learning in the developing world, was infuriated when a prominent professor pompously opined that it was only the granting of full university status that allowed research of any significance. In response, Oppenheim decided to draw the attention of the University of Oxford to the mathematical work that he had completed while at Raffles. He not only made his point but his research and contributions were so significant, he was promptly awarded a second doctorate, a D.Sc., in Science, despite the fact he was not an enrolled student in the D.Sc. program. Oppenheim helped transform the tiny unknown Raffles College into the National University of Singapore, now one of the top research universities in the world. During WWII, Oppenheim who was captured by the Japanese and held as a POW, fled Singapore for a short time to pursue. He pursued research in Switzerland at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and at Einstein's alma mater, the ETH. Oppenheim had a number of interests, including horticulture, growing and raising his own roses, politics, board-games, card-games and intellectual walks. Oppenheim married his first wife Beatrice in 1930, at age 27, with whom he had one child. They had met at the University of Chicago. Oppenheim's wife's sister, Allegra, was also a graduate student at the University of Chicago, earning her Master's Degree in Education. After 47 years of marriage, Oppenheim divorced his first wife in 1977. Oppenheim remarried in 1982 at the age of 79 and had two sons with his second wife. Oppenheim died of natural causes in 1997, at the age of 94. Oppenheim is survived by his second wife, three children, and several nephews and nieces. To the end of his life, he read widely and remained capable of the most perceptive, pithy and amusing commentary on the problems both of old age and of the wider world."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"10906565243326693454","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1295059937994543754","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"6968726908160095830","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"12326035789351311160","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"12075143618468024163","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6968726908160095830","judgment":"no"}]}

To the disgust of his barber father, Luis (Gregory Sierra), John wears his hair long and plays guitar; his father views him as a hippie. Greg Giraldo was in reality a graduate of Harvard Law School nearly top of his class, and became a lawyer for a while before becoming a comedian. After a year as an attorney, Giraldo fell out of love with the profession and launched his comedy career, only referring to his law background very occasionally on the stand-up circuit, until he starred in this series."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"12326035789351311160","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16671464637895630418","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"10865367442061928261","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"3027237892993046497","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6736745672381419418","judgment":"no"}]}

In 1937, Sandor Salgo and a string quartet would serenade the bed-ridden wife of the American Ambassador to Hungary. America's walls were closed to immigrants, but the Ambassador refused to leave Mr. Salgo behind and he was afforded a special visa to America in 1937. While Salgo returned to Europe later in his life, he refused ever to visit Hungary or even speak Hungarian, because of the repressive government during his youth, the anti-Semitism, and in the Nazi years, the holocaust. In 1939 (with no formal training in English) Sandor Salgo taught at the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey. It was during this time at Princeton that Albert Einstein attended one of Mr. Salgo's concerts. He sent him a letter of appreciation saying, ``Mr. Sandor Salgo is a musician of high standing. The concert he gave ... has made a deep impression on me,'' the two played occasionally in a quartet together. Sandor Salgo was asked to conduct the Israeli symphony but politely declined saying, ``I came here to be an American.'' From 1949-1973 Sandor Salgo taught and conducted the music and opera programs at Stanford University. Sandor and Priscilla Salgo began directing the Carmel Bach festival in 1956 and turned it into an internationally acclaimed festival.

It was inspired by the Alto, but used a more modular design powered by a Motorola 68000 processor interfaced to other circuit boards using Multibus.

At that time modern Canada did not exist (it was created by the British North American Act of 1867): ``Canada'' consisted of Canada West (modern Ontario) and Canada East (modern Quebec). By 1859, Montreal, unlike the rest of Canada East, was predominantly English-speaking and was the largest city with a population of about 90,000, rising to about one million during Adams' lifetime. There were two public school systems: French (Catholic) and English (Protestant). Adams attended the Montreal High School, a private school founded in 1843, and after 1852, closely associated with McGill University . As a pupil there, Adams no doubt received a classical education, and his knowledge of Latin was valuable later in life in his historical studies. He matriculated at age 16 and entered the Applied Sciences Program at McGill University, where he studied geology with John William Dawson (Principal of McGill since 1852) and Bernard Harrington (who had set up the Applied Sciences program). In unpublished notes he described Harrington as ``the professor who influenced me chiefly.'' He graduated with first class honors in Applied Sciences in 1878, then spent a year at the Yale Scientific School, where he studied German, French, and Mineralogy. It was there that he met George Wessel Hawes (1848-1882) a pioneer American petrologist, who had worked with Rosenbusch in Germany. He also met a fellow-student, Andrew C. Lawson, and in 1888 they published a joint paper on their investigation of the mineral scapolite. Returning to Montreal, he was appointed Assistant Chemist at the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), and the following year (when the GSC moved to Ottawa), Assistant Chemist and Petrographer . He received a leave of absence to spend at least part of two years in Heidelberg, studying with Harry Rosenberg (1836-1914), who by that time was the acknowledged master of microscopic petrography of igneous rocks. Rosenberg attracted students from many different countries: while Adams was in Heidelberg he met G.H. Williams and J.S. Diller both of whom later became leading American petrologists, and also V. Goldschmidt and A. Osann, who became famous geochemists in Europe . In 1883, Adams published the first work in Canada that made full use of the petrographic microscope, as well as a paper indicating that he had already begun the field work north of Montreal, that later became the basis of his doctorate at Heidelberg. He received a Masters degree from McGill in 1884, and his Ph.D. from Heidelberg University in 1892. His doctoral studies on the Morin anorthosite, showed that these rocks were not metamorphosed sediments, as thought previously, but were igneous rocks that has been intruded into Grenville sediments and later metamorphosed in the Grenville orogeny."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"12086754839319333463","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1264223381988340244","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13263558342802011415","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1666978224370465111","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"18153321702395861849","judgment":"yes"}]}

She would tell her students, ``You have a perfect right to branch out, if you have the stuff in you, if you discover your own richness, if you have something to say.'' Holm's philosophy of teaching was how to find the essence of dance and understand where the movement comes from in the body that way it is a natural response in the dancer's body. She brought weltanschauung to her dance teaching. Holm was strict; she expected greatness from her students which would come from a willingness to work hard. It was her thought that if you worked hard and truly wanted it, you would achieve the desired outcome. Holm had an extremely keen eye, she had the ability to look at something and verbalize what she wanted using elaborate imagery and analogies. She used her technique class as a preparation for her improvisation and composition classes. These classes were where the students could expand and experiment on the skills that were presented in class, making the movement innate in their bodies. A large amount of Holm's choreography came from the improv and comp classes. Hanya Holm taught anatomy, Dalcroze eurhythmics, improvisation, and Labanotation at her school. She taught at Colorado College, Mills College, University of Wisconsin, Alwin Nikolais School, and was the Head of Dance Department in New York's Musical Theatre Academy. After 1974, she taught at the Juilliard School (Martha Hill, director) in New York.

Dzierzon's paper, published in 1845, proposed that while queen bees and female worker bees were products of fertilization, drones were not, and that the diets of immature bees contributed to their subsequent roles. His results caused a revolution in bee crossbreeding and may have influenced Gregor Mendel's pioneering genetic research. The theory remained controversial until 1906, the year of Dzierzon's death, when it was finally accepted by scientists at a conference in Marburg. In 1853 he acquired a colony of Italian bees to use as genetic markers in his research, and sent their progeny ``to all the countries of Europe, and even to America.''

At the time of his death, several of the Cincinnati papers spoke very favorably of him.'' Luther admits that he does not even know whether Daniel Isaac was a Christian, but continued that ``Fervently do I hope that he was, for it is a dreadful thought that any of those we love, and especially one so dear as a Brother, should be called unprepared, from time into eternity, there to suffer forever for the misdeeds of this life.'' Rev. Gotwald's brother, Rev. Washington Van Buren Gotwald, was a Lutheran minister in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He attended Pennsylvania College from which he graduated in 1860. He served for one year as Tutor in the Preparatory Department at Gettysburg. He was a member of the Philo Literary Society and of the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity. After a two years`` course in the Theological Seminary, he was ordained by the Pennsylvania Synod at its meeting in 1862 at Reading. He served first for four years as minister at Emmitsburg, Maryland. In 1866, he became the minister of St. John's Lutheran Church at Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His work in both of these ministries was widely praised. Unfortunately, he died at Lancaster on June 10, 1869. His early death was greatly mourned by his parishioners and colleagues."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"7379787628707821873","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"6570687721363324718","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"12086754839319333463","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"675474584163354109","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1295059937994543754","judgment":"no"}]}

Travelling eastward, at first via Varanasi, Xuanzang reached Vaisali, Pataliputra (Patna) and Bodh Gaya. He was then accompanied by local monks to Nalanda, the great Buddhist university of Indian state of Bihar, where he spent at least the next two years. He was in the company of several thousand scholar-monks, whom he praised. Xuanzang studied logic, grammar, Sanskrit, and the Yogacara school of Buddhism during his time at Nalanda. René Grousset notes that it was at Nalanda (where an ``azure pool winds around the monasteries, adorned with the full-blown cups of the blue lotus; the dazzling red flowers of the lovely kanaka hang here and there, and outside groves of mango trees offer the inhabitants their dense and protective shade'') that Xuanzang met the venerable Silabhadra, the monastery's superior. Silabhadra had dreamt of Xuanzang's arrival and that it would help spread far and wide the Holy Law. Grousset writes: ``The Chinese pilgrim had finally found the omniscient master, the incomparable metaphysician who was to make known to him the ultimate secrets of the idealist systems... The founders of Mahayana idealism, Asanga and Vasubandhu... Dignaga... Dharmapala had in turn trained Silabhadra. Siladhadra was thus in a position to make available to the Sino-Japanese world the entire heritage of Buddhist idealism, and the Siddhi Hiuan Tsang's great philosophical treatise...is none other than the Summa of this doctrine, the fruit of seven centuries of Indian Buddhist thought.''"}],"judgments":[{"rater":"7379787628707821873","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"1295059937994543754","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"652625289254394043","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6968726908160095830","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"12075143618468024163","judgment":"no"}]}

Evidently his time in Japan significantly shaped his research focus and much of his writing is based on many years of participant observation in Japan's education system. A fascination with the ``staginess of social life'' and simulation theory colors his work, and his interest in the intersection of psychology and politics is apparent in his linking of self-presentation with political economy. The theatricalization of gender roles is the topic of Life in a Japanese Women's College: Learning to Be Ladylike (1997). In Japanese Higher Education as Myth (2002) he asked ``why do so many students pretend-study and so many faculty pretend-teach?'' and investigated the disconnect between official policies and actual pedagogical practices. He termed the loss of academic value and poor quality schooling ``institutional mendacity,'' a claim that earned him both criticism and praise in Japan.

Shakur, accompanied by one of his friends, Dana ``Mouse'' Smith, as his beatbox, won most of the many rap competitions that he participated in and was considered to be the best rapper in his school. He was remembered as one of the most popular kids in his school because of his sense of humor, superior rapping skills, and ability to mix in with all crowds. He developed a close friendship with a young Jada Pinkett (later Jada Pinkett Smith) that lasted until his death. In the documentary , Shakur says, ``Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life,'' and Pinkett Smith calls him ``one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime.''

In 1911, as a small child, Mark Rein left Russia with his parents, who were escaping from the tsarist police. In 1917 he returned to Russia with his parents; his father played a role in the events of the Revolution of 1917. In 1920, aged 11, Mark Rein left Russia again with his parents. He lived mostly in Berlin and Paris. As a young man he became a member of the Menshevik RSDRP, the German Social Democratic Party and the Swedish Social Democratic Party. In 1932 he graduated from the Berlin Polytechnic. He worked as a journalist for several socialist papers. He was more sympathetic to the Soviet Union than his father, and for awhile supported the idea of a unification of social-democratic and communist parties. In 1936 he went to Spain to support the Republican, anti-fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War. On April 9, 1937, he was kidnapped in Barcelona by agents of the Soviet secret service OGPU. He was spirited to Russia, apparently with the intention of using him in the show trial of Alexey Rykov and Nikolai Bukharin. He was supposed to connect the accused in the third Moscow Trial in 1938 to the exiled Menshevik leadership. The kidnapping was apparently organised by A.M. Orlov, who supervised the kidnapping and execution of left-wing opponents of Stalin in Spain during the Civil War and later defected to the USA. In spite of frantic efforts by Rafail Abramovich and western socialist supporters, he was never seen alive again and is thought to have been murdered by the OGPU."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1666978224370465111","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"15105723552637340343","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16671464637895630418","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6968726908160095830","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"3027237892993046497","judgment":"yes"}]}

Bandler then approached John Grinder, then a linguistics lecturer.

At the time, Bandler was an undergraduate student at University of California, Santa Cruz, and had begun running Gestalt therapy workshops to refine his skills. While at UCSC, Bandler invited assistant professor of linguistics Dr. John Grinder to observe his Gestalt workshops, to help build an explicit model of how Bandler (and Perls) did Gestalt therapy.

In 1907, aged 9, she gained a scholarship to the Brussels Conservatory, where she studied with Oscar Back (or Oskar Back) for three years, under the general guidance of César Thomson (later, when she had achieved fame, Back and Thomson would both claim to have been her primary teacher). She was accompanied by her mother, who remained with her until her death when Alma was aged 20. In 1913 she was recommended to Max Reger, who, after hearing her play, wrote to his patron Duke George of Sachsen-Meiningen: Today a 13-year-old girl was actually 15 at the time -- English -- played for me; hers is the biggest violin talent I have ever encountered. The 13-year-old played Bach solo sonatas for me, sonatas which are the most difficult to play of any in the whole literature of violin music ... I am not ashamed to admit that there were tears in my eyes while this delicate 13-year-old child played for me. Our Lord God has certainly created one of his miracles. In Meiningen, Eisenach and Hildburghausen Alma Moodie played concertos with Reger conducting, and she appeared in recital with him. Reger also recommended her to other concert organisers. In 1914, he dedicated to her his Präludium und Fuge for solo violin, Op. 131a, No. 4. The Regers had no children, and being fatherless, Alma treated Max Reger as her father for some time. Her mother had planned to return to Australia, leaving Alma in the care of Max and Elsa Reger, but the start of World War I meant she could not leave Europe. The Moodies stayed in Meiningen for the first few months of the war, and then moved to Brussels. Reger died in 1916, without ever seeing Alma again. Times were very hard in Brussels for Alma and her mother. Alma became thin and ill, and claimed she did not touch her violin for four years. Her mother died of consumption or influenza in the spring of 1918."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"3027237892993046497","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"6570687721363324718","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"2602923580436067777","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16959325387609365299","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1264223381988340244","judgment":"yes"}]}

Glen Wever, one of the giants in physiological acoustics. At that time, acceptance of the processes underlying spatial perception by echolocation was not universal, and one of the exciting moments of his graduate training came when a skeptical Nobel Laureate, Georg von Békésy, on one of his periodic visits to Wever's lab, came to see the behaving bats in ``Building B.```` The demonstration that Simmons conducted not only convinced Békésy that bats echolocated but that they also use echo delay to estimate target distance. It was not until some years later that Simmons found out that this was a set-up engineered by Wever and Donald Griffin, who was then at the Rockefeller University, to convince Békésy about the bat's extraordinary use of echolocation to determine target range. Simmons's dissertation was entitled ''Perception of target distance by echolocating bats.```` After receiving his Ph.D., Simmons remained at Princeton University as a National Institutes of Health postdoctoral trainee for two years."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"2791701447620769094","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"11495735324295360935","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13263558342802011415","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"316032166391630975","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1666978224370465111","judgment":"yes"}]}

Jewell was flying a Moisant-Blériot monoplane, a version of the Blériot XI built under licence by the Moisant Aeroplane Company, Queens, New York, and, at least according some reports, powered by a Gnome Lambda 80hp rotary engine rather than the more normal Gnome Omega, 50hp. Witnesses observed the aircraft off the south shore of Long Island, apparently being blown out to sea. The captain of a fishing vessel reported seeing an aircraft resembling Jewell's off Sandy Hook. As Jewell was unable to swim and his only flotation device was the inner tube of a tyre, his chances of surviving a ditching at sea were poor, even if he managed to get clear of the wreckage of his aircraft.

Endowed with an outgoing temperament, Fowler was connected to numerous classicists in North America and Europe. His command of Italian enabled him to give even extemporized talks in that language. Thus, he became an important middleman between Italian Latinists and British classicists in the eighties. He kept close ties in particular with Gian Biagio Conte and Alessandro Barchiesi and the Italian peridiocal Materiali e discussioni per l'analisi dei testi classici. Fowler also was on the editorial boards of further periodicals (amongst others Journal of Roman Studies and Arachnion)."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"6063741883945424276","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"5346153820624061638","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"6905422328658452998","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"12086754839319333463","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1666978224370465111","judgment":"yes"}]}

He was born at Kedleston Hall, built on the site where his family, who were of Norman ancestry, had lived since the 12th century. His mother, worn out by childbirth, died when George was 16; her husband survived her by 41 years. Neither parent exerted a major influence on Curzon's life. The Baron was an austere and unindulgent father who believed in the long-held family tradition that landowners should stay on their land and not go ``roaming about all over the world''. He thus had little sympathy for those travels across Asia between 1887 and 1895 which made his son one of the most traveled men who ever sat in a British cabinet. A more decisive presence in Curzon's childhood was that of his brutal governess, Ellen Mary Paraman, whose tyranny in the nursery stimulated his combative qualities and encouraged the obsessional side of his nature. Paraman periodically forced him to parade through the village wearing a conical hat bearing the words liar, sneak, and coward. Curzon later noted, ``No children well born and well-placed ever cried so much and so justly.'' He was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford. At Eton he was a favorite of Oscar Browning, an over-intimate relationship that led to his tutor's dismissal. While at Eton, he was a controversial figure who was liked and disliked with equal intensity by large numbers of masters and other boys. This strange talent for both attraction and repulsion stayed with him all his life: few people ever felt neutral about him. At Oxford he was President of the Union and Secretary of the Oxford Canning Club. Although he failed to achieve a first class degree in Greats, he won the Lothian and Arnold Prizes, the latter for an essay on Sir Thomas More (about whom he confessed to having known almost nothing before commencing study, literally delivered as the clocks were chiming midnight on the day of the deadline). He was elected a prize fellow of All Souls College in 1883."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"16671464637895630418","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6905422328658452998","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"12022408018620867151","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6570687721363324718","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"13263558342802011415","judgment":"no"}]}

The beginning is characterized by a distinctly abrupt sound, meant to grab the audience's attention. The piece starts out with an ascending dissonant scale. The trumpets then play a fast monotone of sixteenth notes, followed by a slower ascending three note pattern. This repeats several times, the trombones adding to the trumpet double tonguing attack, then the band pauses with a chord fading to silence. Then, what sounds like churchbells make a repeating 3-note pattern. The flutes and clarinets then play repeating notes adding to the bells, and finally the french horns enter with a sweet and majestic melody that sounds like the music used commonly in movies as the ``love amidst a war theme'' its sweet and majestic sound sound like the lovers being together against all odds, and the fast tempo, pounding drumbeat, frantic pulsing of flutes and clarinets, and the fanfare note patterns of the melody make the feeling of a war going on in the background. Once this melody runs its course, we go ``back to the battle'' and hear the trumpets fast tonguing. after this, all brass instruments play a syncopated monotone that ends in the final, sustained chord of the piece."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"6905422328658452998","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6968726908160095830","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"15105723552637340343","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"12326035789351311160","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"12022408018620867151","judgment":"no"}]}

He taught math at Ramapo College in New Jersey, and also taught for brief periods at the University of South Florida and the University of Kentucky. His work includes several large abstract paintings created by staining raw, unprimed canvas with thinned paint, allowing the colors to soak directly into the weave of the canvas. He was represented by and exhibited at the Knoedler & Co. Gallery in New York City from 1979--1986 and was named New Talent Graphic artist of the year in 1963 by Art in America on the recommendation of MoMA curators Dorothy Miller and William S. Lieberman. In 1979 he was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship and in 1982 he received a New Jersey Council on the Arts Award. He exhibited paintings in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum ``Younger American Painters'' (May 12 to July 25, 1954) - alongside William Baziotes, Morris Louis, Richard Diebenkorn, Adolph Gottlieb, Philip Guston, Franz Kline, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock and others.

He and David Hurst Thomas have written an introductory textbook titled Archaeology that is widely used in many colleges and universities. Kelly's book The Foraging Spectrum: Diversity in Hinter-Gatherer Lifeways, published in 1995, is considered to be a landmark in anthropology. In the book, Kelly points out that lifeways among foraging societies were quite diverse.

Their first recording, ``He Don't Really Love You'', was for Moon Shot in 1966. Daniels was drafted and left for the service in 1968 and Edlightoon and Merfhab left the group a few weeks later. At Cameo, producer Stan Watson introduced them to producer Thom Bell, then working with Chubby Checker. With Cameo they recorded a popular tune called ``You've Been Untrue''. The group's first album, released on Watson's own Philly Groove record label, featured the smash hit ``La-La (Means I Love You)'' in 1968. The single sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Four more Bell-produced albums appeared in the next few years: The Sound of Sexy Soul, The Delfonics Super Hits, The Delfonics and Tell Me This Is a Dream. Among the Delfonics' popular hits were the Grammy-winning ``Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)'', ``(For The Love) I Gave To You'', ``Ready or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide from Love)'', and ``Hey Love''. Prior to the release of ``La-La (Means I Love You)'', they had a hit with ``He Don't Really Love You'' on the small Moonshot record label in 1966. The Delfonics and Bell had to work with a basic budget on the first creation as Thom explained ``When I took them into the studio we didn't have any money to pay for string players and an orchestra so I played most of the instruments myself!'' - a far cry from the full classical productions from 1968 to the beginning of the seventies. ``Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)'' also sold a million copies and by March 1970 received a gold disc from the R.I.A.A.."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1666978224370465111","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"15508466506567648824","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"2791701447620769094","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"18153321702395861849","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1264223381988340244","judgment":"yes"}]}

Mark's brother Rick recorded and produced the first Milhouse CD, for which Mark wrote and performed an instrumental Latin-flamenco track named ``Para Mija Linda''. Written for his future wife, this song inspired him very much, and he started to write more guitar music in different Spanish styles. Mark created a few instrumentals and then began collaboration with Alex Ruiz, who wrote lyrics to several of songs. Mark offered these songs to his brother Rick del Castillo. Rick liked them very much. The brothers realized that they had never worked together before and decided to start writing and playing music together. Mark now plays guitar and sings in the Del Castillo band he founded together with his brother Rick. Along with the other members of Del Castillo Mark also plays in Robert Rodríguez's Chingon band."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"11495735324295360935","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"675474584163354109","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6736745672381419418","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"8168332594954722700","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"14447675271069668697","judgment":"no"}]}

Hutton was the holder of the then record Test score of 364 and had by far the best batting average of either team in 1950-51 (88.83) and 1953 (55.37). The main problem was finding a suitable opening partner once Cyril Washbrook (42.81) had retired. Reg Simpson (33.35) was the only other opener in the team and thought the job should be his. He had been on the sidelines for years, and had made 156 not out at Melbourne in the 1950-51 Ashes series to beat Australia for the first time in 12 years. Though chosen for the First Test he failed and did not find his form until late in the series. As a result Hutton chopped and changed the batting order as Bailey, Edrich and Graveney was all pushed into the number two slot. England's opener problem remained unsolved until the emergence of John Edrich and Geoffrey Boycott in the 1960s. With the strong Australian bowling on their home turf runs were hard to come by and only the obstinate stonewaller Barnacle Bailey exceeded his career Test average in a low scoring series (37.00 over 29.74). Keith Miller wrote ``I reckon he has saved more matches for England than anyone else since the war. His figures belie his worth to England. When a fielding side sees him coming in, a trough of deep depression immediately settles around the area''. Bill Edrich had been a Squadron Leader during the war and won the DFC for his part in the ``RAF's most audacious and dangerous low-level bombing raid'' on Cologne in 1941. Edrich had ``an immense relief that he survived'' becoming a bon viveur who lived for the day and a gutsy batsman who was ``almost indifferent to his own safety. No bowler is too fast to hook; no score too large to defy challenge.'' Vic Wilson was strapping Yorkshire farmer who could hit the ball many a mile, but failed to come to terms with the Australian pitches. The baby-faced Colin Cowdrey, a 21 year old Oxford under-graduate and the youngest member of the side, was a real find with his immaculate timing of the ball in the first of a record six tours of Australia. ``The 22-year-old had received news of his father's death at the start of the tour, but soldiered on, thanks to the advice and encouragement from his young teammate Peter May and father figure and captain Len Hutton''. Even so, Hutton made a small bet that Wilson would score more Test runs than Cowdrey on the tour Tyson worked on his batting and in 1954 ``was building up a reputation as an all-rounder, scoring consistently with the bat'', and even batted at number seven on the tour. The team scored fewer Test runs than any England team in Australia for fifty years, but with such talent somebody usually got the vital runs and, except at Brisbane, England had the advantage."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1264223381988340244","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"16671464637895630418","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"11594982675307016661","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"6968726908160095830","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13263558342802011415","judgment":"yes"}]}

Zimmer began his career playing keyboards and synthesizers. He worked with The Buggles, a New Wave band formed in 1977 with Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes, and Bruce Woolley. Zimmer can be seen briefly in The Buggles' music video for the 1979 song ``Video Killed the Radio Star''. After working with The Buggles, he started to work for the Italian group Krisma, a New Wave band formed in 1976 with Maurizio Arcieri and Christina Moser. He was a featured synthesist for Krisma's third album, Cathode Mamma. He has also worked with the band Helden (with Warren Cann from Ultravox).

Despite Barât's intolerance of Wolfe and the associated drugs, he recorded guitar for the B-side to the single, ``Back From the Dead''. Mick Jones returned as producer for the second attempt to record the second album. Doherty had returned to his drug habit and so relationships were strained.
